Issues to fix:
- Short Side field
- Paper short side cannot exceed 42"
- Vinyl short side???
- Laminate short cannot exceed sheet width - 2" ?
- function to fit prints to paper based on size ???

- Canvas
	updating length does not change paper-type cost which was set when canvas was selected


=========================================================
36" paper is more than 42" (don't know why).  Let's make the cost calculations for 36" and 
42" wide paper consistent with the way costs are calculated for other/custom.  I would like it to be as 
simple as possible.  So any suggestions you have would be great.  Also the cost should be different for 
specific paper types.

Thanks again for your help

mounting is not required for the canvas and vinyl prints, but we will need it for the 
Noritsu.
